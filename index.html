    <p>
      I am a proud graduate of Keene State College, holding both a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My background combines a strong understanding of legal systems with technical expertise, particularly in computer networking and security. I have hands-on experience with UDP and TCP protocols, as well as a proven track record in tutoring peers in complex subjects, demonstrating both communication and leadership skills. I am eager to apply my diverse knowledge and practical skills in a real-world environment, contributing to a company’s success by helping its team grow, innovate, and achieve their goals.
