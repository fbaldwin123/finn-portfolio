    <h2>Passion for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice</h2>
    <p>
      I've had a strong passion for law enforcement and the criminal justice system from a young age. 
      In high school, I was an active member of the Youth and Government Club, where I had the opportunity 
      to participate in mock legislative sessions at the New Hampshire State House. I drafted and debated 
      mock bills, gaining firsthand experience in how our government and justice systems work. 
      These experiences solidified my commitment to serving and protecting the community while understanding 
      how policies and laws shape society.

    <h2>Passion for Sports and Teamwork</h2>
    <p>
      I'm also deeply passionate about sports. I support all New England sports teams, and I’ve always enjoyed 
      the spirit of competition and camaraderie that comes with being part of a team. Throughout my life, 
      I’ve played basketball, baseball, and various other team sports. These experiences have taught me the 
      importance of discipline, teamwork, leadership, and perseverance—qualities that I bring with me into 
      every professional environment.

    <h2>Technical Skills and Interests</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to my interests in law enforcement and athletics, I have developed strong technical skills 
      in the field of computer science. I’m experienced with Python, Java, and networking protocols such as 
      TCP and UDP. I have studied and implemented systems involving firewalls, data security, and networking 
      fundamentals. My skills also include working with NetBeans, developing projects that demonstrate 
      knowledge of both front-end and back-end programming. I’m passionate about combining my tech expertise 
      with my interest in security to pursue meaningful work that protects and informs others.
