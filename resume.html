    <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Recent computer science graduate with a strong foundation in both tech and criminal justice, looking to bring my skills into a hands-on role.
      I have a strong understanding of protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and more. I've worked with languages like Python and JavaScript, built projects
      in NetBeans, and studied everything from cybersecurity to homeland security. I've also spent time tutoring, working in security, and taking on
      leadership roles in college and in my local community. I am someone who works well with others, takes initiative, and stays committed to
      learning. I'm ready to take what I've learned in school and apply it in a real-world environment, where I can keep growing.
